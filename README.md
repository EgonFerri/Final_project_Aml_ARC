# ABSTRACTION AND REASONING CHALLENGE

What is intelligence?  Trying to synthesize the common sense, a suitable definitions couldbe:  “Intelligence is the ability of an agent to achieve goals (being highly skilled) in a widerange of environments (being able to generalize).” If we assume this definition, seems clearthat what is commonly known as an Artificial Intelligence, is today only capable to matchthe first part of this definition,  not being able to generalize.  This is the reason that leadFrancois Chollet to set the Abstract Reasoning Challenge, giving a data set and a benchmarkto measure the power of a model to generalize knowledge from many simple tasks.  But whatare the limits of the state of the art deep-learning in handling a task of this type?  The aimof  our  work  will  be  to  try  to  answer  this  question  in  a  manner  as  clear  and  complete  aspossible.
